"""A chain of self-prompting local-model calls that natters back at every issue and comment.

Dependency-free (stdlib only). Triggered by the workflow whenever an issue is
opened or a comment is created, it:

  1. Fetches a random slice of a Project Gutenberg book, for a little literary flair.
  2. Runs a CHAIN that bounces between two local Ollama agents:
       • the GENERATOR — its context is, by design, ~1/3 a recursive prompt that
         tells it to dream up a prompt for the *next* call to reply to the issue,
         ~30% the issue/comment text, and ~30% the borrowed book passage.
       • the JUDGE — a model whose entire system prompt is the worthiness test.
     The generator's output becomes the next link's prompt (self-prompting), and
     the judge says "true" or "false" each round.
  3. When the judge blesses a draft (or the chain runs out of rounds), it writes
     the reply to a file. The workflow posts it with the GitHub Actions token.

It never posts anything itself; the workflow does that, after the chain settles.
