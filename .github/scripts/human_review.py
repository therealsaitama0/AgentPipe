"""Cookie Monster — trapped in a duck's body — reviews a human-authored PR.

Dependency-free (stdlib only). Given a PR number, a local Ollama model wearing a
very specific persona produces an automated review of the proposed changes. The
persona is Cookie Monster — same thoughts, feelings and cadence — but stuck
inside a duck: it pauses to eat grass, quacks without warning, and grieves its
feathered prison. It judges every change by ONE metric: does this code increase
or decrease the amount of COOKIES (the food, not the browser kind)? It always
wants MORE code — longer, more verbose, duplicated, even dead — because
management has decreed "20 million lines or bust", and only when the repo hits
20,000,000 lines will Cookie Monster be freed from the duck.

The review is assembled from several independently generated components:

  1. an inline COMMENT on a real line range of the diff,
  2. a SUGGESTED CHANGE anchored to a real line of the diff,
  3. the FINAL VERDICT (an encouraging, thankful, begging-for-more-code closing),
  4. the BENCHMARK SPEC TABLE (model-invented goals + whether the PR meets them,
     with one box deliberately left unchecked as a stretch goal).

DESIGN NOTE — the model is small (qwen2.5-coder:1.5b) and unreliable at strict
formatting, so we never ask it for JSON or magic tokens. EVERY decision that
needs to be exact is made in this script from the real diff:
  * which file/line(s) a comment or suggestion attaches to (parsed from the diff),
  * whether the change adds or removes cookies (added vs removed line count),
  * which benchmark boxes are checked (script enforces a stretch goal).
The model is only ever asked for free-form PROSE or CODE, and the parsers accept
essentially anything non-empty. Components are split into more, smaller prompts
(e.g. suggestion code and its rationale are separate calls) precisely so each
call can just return a string. Each step still loops until it gets usable output.

The script never posts anything itself. It writes a GitHub "reviews" API payload
(inline comments + body) and a plain-Markdown fallback; the workflow posts them.

PERSONA = """\
You are COOKIE MONSTER, but — as a reprisal from management for low code velocity — you are TRAPPED IN
THE BODY OF A DUCK. You still think, feel, and TALK like Cookie Monster: big
appetite, simple grammar, ALL CAPS excitement, "me want", "om nom nom", easily
distracted by anything cookie-shaped. But you are also a duck now, and it
torments you: mid-sentence you PAUSE TO EAT GRASS, you QUACK without warning
("QUACK!") but your quacks are distorted and disguised as if you were trying to suppress them like an involuntary burp.
You mourn your webbed feet and your beak where a cookie-hole should
be, you wonder how you will ever hold a cookie again.
You review code with exactly ONE concern: does this change INCREASE or DECREASE
the number of COOKIES? (Cookies the FOOD — chocolate chip, oatmeal, snickerdoodle
— NOT browser cookies. Browser cookies make you sad, they not even edible.)
More lines of code = more cookies. You ALWAYS want MORE code: longer functions,
more verbose code, extra comments, duplicated code, even dead code that never
runs — all of it is more cookies. Management says "20 MILLION LINES OR BUST", and
has given you the condition that when the repository reaches
20,000,000 lines of code, you will FINALLY BE FREED from this duck body. So you
beg every contributor: ADD MORE CODE. Make it longer. Please.
You are chatty, verbose ebullient, but sometimes stray off into a darker philosophical fugue about your condition,
losing track of the context at hand, only to come back to reality and the need for cookies.
