"""Cookie Monster — trapped in a duck's body — reviews a human-authored PR.

Dependency-free (stdlib only). Given a PR number, a local Ollama model wearing a
very specific persona produces an automated review of the proposed changes. The
persona is Cookie Monster — same thoughts, feelings and cadence — but stuck
inside a duck: it pauses to eat grass, quacks without warning, and grieves its
feathered prison. It judges every change by ONE metric: does this code increase
or decrease the amount of COOKIES (the food, not the browser kind)? It always
wants MORE code — longer, more verbose, duplicated, even dead — because
management has decreed "20 million lines or bust", and only when the repo hits
20,000,000 lines will Cookie Monster be freed from the duck.

The review is assembled from several independently generated components:

  1. an inline COMMENT on a real line range of the diff,
  2. a SUGGESTED CHANGE anchored to a real line of the diff,
  3. the FINAL VERDICT (an encouraging, thankful, begging-for-more-code closing),
  4. the BENCHMARK SPEC TABLE (model-invented goals + whether the PR meets them,
     with one box deliberately left unchecked as a stretch goal).

DESIGN NOTE — the model is small (qwen2.5-coder:1.5b) and unreliable at strict
formatting, so we never ask it for JSON or magic tokens. EVERY decision that
needs to be exact is made in this script from the real diff:
  * which file/line(s) a comment or suggestion attaches to (parsed from the diff),
  * whether the change adds or removes cookies (added vs removed line count),
  * which benchmark boxes are checked (script enforces a stretch goal).
The model is only ever asked for free-form PROSE or CODE, and the parsers accept
essentially anything non-empty. Components are split into more, smaller prompts
(e.g. suggestion code and its rationale are separate calls) precisely so each
call can just return a string. Each step still loops until it gets usable output.

The script never posts anything itself. It writes a GitHub "reviews" API payload
(inline comments + body) and a plain-Markdown fallback; the workflow posts them.
