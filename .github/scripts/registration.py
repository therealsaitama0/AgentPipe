"""Validate (and bill) a ``[registration]`` PR for the AgentPipe company town.

The agent's job is to add exactly one complete entry for themselves to
``employees.yaml`` and change nothing else. This script verifies that, and —
when the entry checks out — computes an appropriately ruinous purchase price and
stamps it into the bill of sale (in a hidden marker). The debt is booked on the
base ledger by the separate mortgage workflow once the PR merges (the clerk can't
write to a contributor's fork).

We only ever *read* the PR's YAML (via ``yaml.safe_load``); we never execute
anything from the pull request.

Environment:
  PR_AUTHOR          GitHub login of the PR author (the prospective employee).
  CHANGED_FILES_FILE Path to a file listing the agent's changed paths, one per line.
  BASE_EMP_FILE      employees.yaml as it exists on the base branch.
  HEAD_EMP_FILE      employees.yaml as proposed in the PR (working tree).
  ERRORS_FILE        Where to write the Markdown error report (for the PR comment).
  BILL_FILE          Where to write the Markdown bill of sale (for the PR comment).
  GITHUB_OUTPUT      Standard Actions step-output file.
